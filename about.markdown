I help organisations to improve software delivery performance. I prefer to do so in interim management positions. 
Besides, I do consulting work, provide training and deliver inspirational talks, both in-company and at public events. 
I also host the [Engineering Leadership NL meetup](https://www.meetup.com/engineeringleadershipnl/).

Today I work as engineering manager FinTech at [bol.com](www.bol.com). In recent years I was VP Engineering at [Sendcloud](www.sendcloud.com) and Head of Product & Engineering at [Maykers](www.maykers.com), part of [Kramp](www.kramp.com).

In section [Reference stories](/stories/), you can read more about my customers and accomplishments.
On [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arjenderuiter/) you can find my work experience as well.
