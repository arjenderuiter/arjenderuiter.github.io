I am manager in software development and operations. I help organisations to improve software delivery performance. 
Besides, I do consulting work and deliver inspirational talks, both in-company and at public events. 
I also host the [Engineering Leadership NL meetup](https://www.meetup.com/engineeringleadershipnl/).

Today I work as Director of Engineering at [Essent](https://www.essent.nl). Before that I was engineering manager FinTech at [bol.com](https://www.bol.com). In recent years I was VP Engineering at [Sendcloud](https://www.sendcloud.com), Head of Product & Engineering at [Maykers](https://www.maykers.com), part of [Kramp](https://www.kramp.com) and CTO at [Coosto](https://www.coosto.com).
