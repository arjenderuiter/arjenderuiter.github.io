I help organisations to improve ðŸš€ software delivery performance. I prefer to do so in interim management positions. 
Besides, I do consulting work, provide training and deliver inspirational talks, both in-company and at public events. 
I also host the Engineering Leadership NL meetup.

In section [Reference stories](/stories/), you can read about my customers and accomplishments.
On [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arjenderuiter/) you can find my work experience as well.
