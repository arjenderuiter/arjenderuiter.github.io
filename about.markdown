I am an experienced technology leader in software development, architecture and operations.<br/>
Today I work at Sendcloud where I help scale the tech organisation to support the company's growth  with focus on the delivery organisation and people development.

I worked at bol.com as software engineering manager, introducing the personalised shopping experience. Then at bol.com I was responsible for the technical platform teams and helped introduce DevOps ways of working. After being CTO at Coosto, I became independent consultant. I have helped clients in SaaS and e-commerce to increase software delivery performance by building well organized development teams, modernising platform and architecture, and moving into new ways of working.
