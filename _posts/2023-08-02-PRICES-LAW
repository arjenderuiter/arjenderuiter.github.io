According to Price's Law, in a team of nine, 3 people do 50% of the work and 6 do the other 50%.

Physicist Derk Price noticed that a small percentage of his peers were making most of the contributions to their field. From this he developed Price's Law or Price's Square Root Law: 50% of all work will be done by the square root of the total number of people who take part in the work.
I have put this in a chart and then you see that the bigger the team, the smaller the minority that does 50% of the work, and the larger the majority that does the other 50%. Any thoughts on why? Leave a comment below ðŸ’­

Now add to this that in software engineering you have diseconomies of scale, and then you get why it feels like your you slow down as you grow.
