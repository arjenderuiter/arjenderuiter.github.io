I am very proud that I have been invited to share my experience with the tech leaders of AholdDelhaize.
On December 14th 2021 I discuss with them how I moved from managing on practices to managing with principles. 
I'll also share my story on how I learned the First Team concept of Pat Lencioni and how that benefited people in the teams.
