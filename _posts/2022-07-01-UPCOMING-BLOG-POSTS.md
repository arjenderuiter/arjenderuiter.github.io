- In May I presented at [Women In Tech Amsterdam 2022](https://www.europeanwomenintech.com/), together with Sadhana Gophal, engneering manager at Shopify
- Early July I hosted the first event in a meetup series called [Speed at Scale](https://www.meetup.com/engineeringleadershipnl/events/286435216/), with talks on test automation, the roles of an architect and context & purpose driven development with Scaleflow
- This summer I an writing a summary of the book The CIO Edge, I moderate it to apply to tech leads and will call it The Tech Lead Edge, available for download soon!
