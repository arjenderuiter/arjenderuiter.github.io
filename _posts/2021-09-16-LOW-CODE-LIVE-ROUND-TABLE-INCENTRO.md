Incentro invited me to join a live conversation on low code.
Is was invited because of my experience building a marketplace for Kramp using a low code platform on top of a headless e-commerce platform.
During the interview we referred several times to my earlier article 'low code through the eyses of a traditional programmer'.

You can watch the recording [here on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/588386859)
