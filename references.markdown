As of June 2023 I am Head of Software Delivery at Essent. The software teams deliver and run solutions that help customers in the energy transition. Besides we make a tech transformation from low-code solutions to custom built services on a serverless platform. 
I am member of the IT Leadership Team together with the CIO, the head of architecture and the head of platform. My teams consists of 5 engineering managers. Each of them manages a product domain with 6 to 8 teams, adding up to about 240 team members in total.

In 2022 and 2023 I helped bol.com deliver their new in-house solution for payment and invoice matching and for managing outstanding payment balances. I was responsible for both business results and IT deliverables. We were organized in 3 software engineering teams and 2 business teams. The solution called MatchMaker consisted of multiples services. Functionally we achieved over 99,5% automatic matching and we delivered a UI for efficiently manging the non-matches. Technically we paid attention to non-functionals, so we could scale up an support bol.com's future business models.
